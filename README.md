I created this map to proivde a better visualization of the Covid-19 testing sites in Chicago by February 25, 2021.\
The dataset was pulled from the Chicago City Data Portal (https://data.cityofchicago.org/Health-Human-Services/COVID-19-Testing-Sites-Map/j2wj-wjrp). 
#### Goals:
- I created a heat map shwoing the distirbution of the testing sites that is overlayed a map showing the community area boundries in Chicago. 
- Finally, I added the addresses of each testing sites for a quick and practical way to see them.
